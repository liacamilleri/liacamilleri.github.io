		<h2> The Story of Shrimp Fried Rice </h2> <br>
		<p> Shrimpington grew up in the outer regions of the Atlantic Ocean, with his family of fellow shrimp. Having a life he felt grateful for, Shrimpington wanted to pursue something more adventurous. He wanted to be a chef.

		Being the first shrimp ever to complete a culinary course, Shrimpington began job hunting. Hundreds of cover letters and resumes were sent to restaurants around the globe. Apparently being a shrimp gets your job offer rejected very quickly! <br><br>

		Shrimpington was about to give up. Put the chef hat away and go home, back into the ocean. But then, Shrimpington had an idea… <br><br>

		<i> What if I made my own restaurant? </i> <br><br>

		And he did! Founding the company that we all know and love.

		For Shrimpington, cooking is everything. It’s what gets him up in the morning. The smiles on customers faces, and the confused critics asking the question: <br><br>

		<p2> Did a shrimp fry this rice? </p2>
